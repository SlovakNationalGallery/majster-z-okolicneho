## An exhibition in 2017 at Esterházyho palác under Dušan Buran

 - Curator: Dušan Buran

 ## TL;DR

 Master of the former Marian altar from the Franciscan monastery in Okoličné
 near Liptovský Mikuláš belongs among the best painters of the Central European
 Late Gothic and he worked with other important Spiš sculptors, including Master
 Pavol.

 Unlike Master Pavol, his work remains relatively unknown – both domestically
 and abroad. Most of the paintings by Master of Okoličné stands out by its
 attractive synthesis of the Dutch Gothic Art (landscape with architecture,
 selective interest in descriptive details) and the Italian Renaissance (figure
 gestures, delicate glazes, etc.). The artist maintained efficient studio,
 source of several others excellent works, today mostly church property (two
 side altars in Smrečany, 1510) or painting the Altar of the Visitation in St.
 Elisabeth Cathedral in Košice (1516).

 The altar, which gave the name to the anonymous painter, was dismantled back
 in the 18th century, but its parts have been preserved in several collections
 in Slovakia, Poland and Hungary. The Slovak National Gallery succeeded in
 acquiring one of the panels in 2010 – Crucifixion – from said altar. Completion
 of its restoration (Petra Hoffstädterová, 2017) is an incentive to organise
 this exhibition.

 The form of the exhibit will be unconventional for many visitors.  It will
 include an analytical exhibition on one floor of the Esterházy Palace, which
 contains about 40-50 Gothic artefacts – altar triptychs, panels, sculptures
 and prints. However, as important as the original pieces will also be the
 presentation of new knowledge from the restoration of the altar panels and
 the historical research directly in Okoličné. The theme of that exhibit will
 be art history and technology (issues of materials, attribution, genesis of
 style, oeuvre studio, etc.) made available to visitors through new media (virtual
 architectural reconstruction, restoration process documentation, use of
 animation graphics, panel paintings).

 The exhibition will be accompanied by a catalogue with several essays on the
 architecture of monastery church, its original altar, but also on noble
 families from Okoličné and Smrečany. They are complemented by the contributions
 by conservators and dendrologists. The publication also includes an annotated
 catalogue of the exhibited works, or more precisely, of all available works
 by Master of Okoličné.

### Theming

The theme 'longread' makes extensive use of [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/). Sass files in `/user/themes/longread/scss/` should be compiled to `/user/themes/longread/css/`, e.g. by using:

    scss --watch user/themes/longread/scss:user/themes/longread/css
    node-sass --watch ./user/themes/longread/scss/ -o ./user/themes/longread/css/
